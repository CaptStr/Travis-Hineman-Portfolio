``` python
#Income Expense Data set as a Housedhold 
import kagglehub

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("ramyapintchy/personal-finance-data")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```

I might want to make this a business Finanacial dashboard, and instead use a data set that reflects this as well. I should find some sort of corporate data set so I can break into Ratios dealing with debt, ROI and Liquidity.
